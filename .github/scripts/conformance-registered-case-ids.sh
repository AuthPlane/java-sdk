# Print the conformance case ids THIS SDK registers, one per line.
#
# This is the repo-specific half of the case-body drift check: the id source
# depends on how this repo's harness records registrations, so it lives here and
# conformance-case-body-drift.sh stays generic.
#
# For this repo the ids come out of conformance-report.json, which the
# conformance suite writes when the JUnit run closes (ConformanceRunState) into
# the directory named by the `conformance.report.dir` system property — set in
# the root pom to the reactor root, so the file lands beside CHANGELOG / README.
# That report is the harness's own record of what registered, so it cannot
# disagree with what the suite actually did — the reason for reading it rather
# than grepping @ConformanceCase("...") annotations out of the test sources,
# which would be a second, weaker id extractor that reports what it matched and
# stays silent about what it missed.
#
# The report lists one entry per CATALOG case, so presence in it is not
# registration. `test_id` is: ConformanceExtension records it when a test
# carrying @ConformanceCase runs, and the placeholder entries the report
# synthesizes for uncovered catalog cases carry only `case_id` and `status`.
# Reading `test_id` rather than `status` matters — a registered case whose test
# failed or was skipped is still registered, and still needs its body watched,
# but its status is not "passed".
#
# Only `.cases` is read. `.uncatalogued_tests` alongside it also carries
# `test_id` entries, but those are tests with no @ConformanceCase mapping at
# all — they have no case id to contribute.
#
# Requires the suite to have run, so the report on disk belongs to this commit.
#
# Inputs (environment):

# Exit status:
#   0  ids printed on stdout
#   1  the report is missing, unreadable, or holds no registered case

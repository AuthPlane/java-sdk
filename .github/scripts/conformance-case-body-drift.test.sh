#
# Both scripts run only on the weekly drift schedule, so a break in either
# surfaces late and quietly — and the way it surfaces is a green run, because
# what they guard against is a check that under-reports. Shellcheck cannot see
# that class at all: a loosened id regex that silently drops cases, or a `diff`
# whose exit code stops being read, is valid shell. These tests pin the
# behaviour instead, so such an edit fails at PR time rather than the next time
# the catalog is re-tightened in place.
#
# The headline case is the real one the drift check exists for: the metadata
# jwks_uri rotation case was re-tightened under an unchanged id between two
# catalog revisions. The fixtures carry a trimmed form of both wordings, so the
# suite asserts against the change that actually happened rather than an
# invented one.
#
# Every fixture is a handful of YAML and JSON written to a temp dir. Nothing
# here checks out the catalog, runs the conformance suite, or needs Maven — the
# point is that these controls stay runnable and fast on a PR.
